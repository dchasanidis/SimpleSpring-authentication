# Simple Spring Boot Authentication from scratch

Every time I want to start a new project, authentication and authorization are always the first issues that come up.
<br>
This project, is a super simple implementation of an authentication and authorization system made from scratch.


Future goals: 
* Tests, tests, tests…
* Application exceptions and not generic runtime exceptions
* Finish/cleanup REST API
* Kafka integration for messaging
* ~~OpenAPI integration for better management of endpoints~~ ✓
* Add more documentation/usage etc
